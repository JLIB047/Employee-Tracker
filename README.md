# Employee-Tracker

## Purpose 
The purpose of this project was to create a MySQL application to be able to keep track of employees.  The application is supposed to track the employee by their department, position, and employee data (ie. first name, last name, employee id and manager id). I was able to re-visit this assignment and update my server.js file with quieres to view and add data.  The query to update the employee role is incorrect.  The error states that the issue is in my SQL syntax, but after reviewing the docs I still dont know what's wrong.  Other than the update query issue, this assignment taught me alot about queries and MySQL.
