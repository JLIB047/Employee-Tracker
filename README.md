# Employee-Tracker

## Purpose 
The purpose of this project was to create a MySQL application to be able to keep track of employees.  The application is supposed to track the employee by their department, position, and employee data (ie. first name, last name, employee id and manager id). I was having issues connecting to my database, but I plan on resubmitting the assignment
